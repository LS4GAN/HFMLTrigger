Welcome to sPHENIX Machine Learning Data Set for Tracking and Heavy Flavor Physics

## Introduction

[sPHENIX](https://www.sphenix.bnl.gov) is a new detector planned for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY, USA. We envision sPHENIX real-time electornics and data aquisition will process continous detector input data stream at a few Tbps, reducing data by about one order of magnitude, and save data to disk at rate of O(100 Gbps). Data reduction at Tbps require advanced realtime computing on FPGA, GPU and CPU. Therefore we are publishing this data set to external machine learning scientists looking for collaboration and inputs.
